Follow the instruction on README-DHCP-Server to construct a DHCP server that will do 
network segmentation to OT and IT private subnets to isolate the traffic on OT and IT networks
as well as port forwarding through the main public IP address.  This way all the 
servers in both OT and IT networks are protected from direct public network access
and at the same time the servers can interact with external network.
