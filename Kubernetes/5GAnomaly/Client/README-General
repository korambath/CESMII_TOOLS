1. First make sure http server is running  

cd ../Server
python ./http_server.py -u 192.168.1.16 -p 8000  (Example)

Then wait for the data receiving code which will be run on MITH cluster later on via a Docker container 


2.python ./get_data_general_arg.py 192.168.1.14 8000


Next step is to send the data that will be received by the code .  Keep repeating the step 3.  You should see an output in Step 2. corresponding
to the action on Step 3.

3. python ./send_event_arg.py 192.168.1.14 8000
