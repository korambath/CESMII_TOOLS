In this example we have connected two BME280 humidity, temperature, pressure sensor
to a single RaspberryPI to demonstrate sparkplug can distinguish data coming from 
two different sensors from the same edge device.

The BME280 codes are in the BME280 directory and the listener code is in this directory.



Please read the link below if you want to know how to connecto two identical sensors to RaspberryPI I2C.
