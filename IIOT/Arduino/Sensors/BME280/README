BME280 sensor from Bosch is an environmental sensor with temperature, barometric pressure and humidity! 
This sensor is great for all sorts of weather/environmental sensing and can be used with  both I2C and SPI!

Step 1. Install Adafruit BME280 library.  

Arduino IDE will install itself if you search for BME280 Adafruit

Step 2. Wiring for I2C and SPI interface are shown in the pictures below.

For I2C wiring StemmaQT is used thereby, but for SPI wiring you need to solder.

SPI = Serial Peripheral Interface
Number of wires 4 (MOSI, MISO, SCK, and SS)
Communication type	Full-duplex
Data transfer speed 	Faster



I2C = Inter-Integrated Circuit.
Number of wires 2 (SDA and SCL) 
Communication type 	Half-duplex 
Serial Data (SDA) – Transfer of data takes place through this pin.
Serial Clock (SCL) – It carries the clock signal.
Data transfer speed 	Slower
