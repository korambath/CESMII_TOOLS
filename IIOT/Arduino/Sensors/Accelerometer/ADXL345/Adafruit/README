Power Pins

This breakout board can be run on 3.3V and 5V systems. We added an on-board 3.3V regulator and logic-level shifting circuitry, 
making it a perfect choice for interfacing with any 3V or 5V microcontroller such as the Arduino.

VIN - This is the input to the 3.3V voltage regulator, which makes it possible to use the 3.3V sensor on 5V systems. 
It also determines the logic level of the SCL and SDA pins. Connect this to 3.3V on the MCU for 3.3V boards (Adafruit Feathers), 
or 5.0V for 5V Arduinos (Arduino Uno, etc.).

3Vo - This is the OUTPUT of the 3.3V regulator, and can be used to provide 3.3V power to other parts of your project if required (< 100mA).
GND - Connect this to the GND pin on your development board to make sure they are sharing a common GND connection, 
or the electrons won't have anywhere to flow!


I2C Pins

SCL - The clock line on the I2C bus. This pin has an internal pullup resistor on the PCB, 
which is required as part of the I2C spec, meaning you don't need to add one externally yourself. 
This also functions as SCK in SPI mode.

SDA - The data line on the I2C bus. This pin has an internal pullup resistor on the PCB, 
which is required as part of the I2C spec, meaning you don't need to add one externally yourself. 
This also functions as MOSI in SPI mode.


SPI Pins

SCL -  functions as SCK in SPI mode.
SDA -  functions as MOSI in SPI mode.
SDO -  functions as MISO in SPI mode
CS  -  functions as the chip select line in SPI mode,


//SCK = Connect the SCL pin to Digital #13 but any pin can be used later
//MISO = Connect the SDO pin to Digital #12 but any pin can be used later
//MOSI = Connect the SDA pin to Digital #11 but any pin can be used later
//CS = Connect the CS pin Digital #10 but any pin can be used later
//Vin = Connect Vin to the power supply, 3V or 5V is fine. Use the same voltage that the microcontroller logic is based off of. For most Arduinos, that is 5V
//GND = Connect GND to common power/data ground

#define ADXL_SCK 13
#define ADXL_MISO 12
#define ADXL_MOSI 11
#define ADXL_CS 10

//Adafruit_ADXL345_Unified accel = Adafruit_ADXL345_Unified(12345); // For I2C
Adafruit_ADXL345_Unified accel = Adafruit_ADXL345_Unified(ADXL_SCK,ADXL_MISO,ADXL_MOSI,ADXL_CS); // For SPI
