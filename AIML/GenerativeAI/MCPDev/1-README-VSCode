Ref: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers


1. To enable MCP support in VS Code, enable the chat.mcp.enabled setting.

This is in the settings.json file
~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json

{
    "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true
}


2. To add an MCP server to your workspace:

   Create a .vscode/mcp.json file in your workspace.

   Then click "Add Server" (selecting mcp.json package)
   select NPM package
   type *playwright/mcp Enter and Allow


3. After that add the Claude example as well.


{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    },
    "weather": {
      "command": "/Users/<change>/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/Users/<change>/MCPDev/mcpsrvclt/src/Ex0",
        "run",
        "weather.py"
      ]
    }
  }
   
}
